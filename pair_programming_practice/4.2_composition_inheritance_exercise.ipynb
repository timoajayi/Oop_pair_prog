    "In this exercise, you will create an `Employee` class to model employees in a business. The class will track information such as the employee's name, position, salary, and status (whether they are currently employed). You will also add methods to allow for updating their salary, changing their position, and marking them as no longer employed:\n",

    "1. **Create the `Employee` class**:\n",
    "    - The class should have the following attributes:\n",
    "        - **`name`**: The name of the employee\n",
    "        - **`position`**: The job title or position of the employee (e.g., \"Manager\").\n",
    "        - **`salary`**: The salary of the employee (e.g., 60000).\n",
    "        - **`employed`**: A boolean value indicating whether the employee is currently employed (default: `True`).\n",
    "2. **Define the `__init__()` method**:\n",
    "    - This method should initialize the attributes `name`, `position`, `salary`, and `employed` when a new employee object is created.\n",
    "3. **Add the following methods**:\n",
    "    - **`give_raise(self, amount)`**: A method that increases the employee's salary by the given `amount`.\n",
    "    - **`change_position(self, new_position)`**: A method to update the employee's position to `new_position`.\n",
    "    - **`terminate(self)`**: A method that marks the employee as no longer employed by setting `employed` to `False`.\n",
    "    - **`__repr__(self)`**: A method to display the employee's details, including their name, position, salary, and employment status."

    "In this exercise, you'll create an **InternEmployee** class that inherits from the **Employee** class you built earlier. The **InternEmployee** class will introduce new features such as tracking the internship's duration and checking if it's still active:\n",

    "1. **Create the `InternEmployee` Class:**\n",
    "   - **Inheritance**: The `InternEmployee` should extend the `Employee` class.\n",
    "   - **New Attribute**:\n",
    "     - `duration`: Specifies the duration of the internship in months.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Define Methods for Internship Management:**\n",
    "   - `check_internship_status()`: This method assesses the internship's current status based on the duration.\n",
    "     - **Conditions**:\n",
    "       - If `duration` > 0: The internship is ongoing, and the method displays the remaining months.\n",
    "       - If `duration` == 0: The internship is completed, and the method shows a completion message.\n",
    "   - `reduce_duration(months)`: Reduces the internship duration by a given number of months.\n",
    "     - **Safety Check**:  Ensure the `duration` doesn't become negative by setting it to zero if the result would be less than zero.\n",
    "  \n",
    "3. **Instantiate and Use the `InternEmployee` Class:**\n",
    "   - **Create an Instance**: Create an `InternEmployee` object with initial parameters.\n",
    "   - **Display Initial Status**: Use the `check_internship_status()` method to display the internship status initially.\n",
    "   - **Modify Internship Duration**: Apply the `reduce_duration(months)` method to simulate the passing of time.\n",
    "   - **Check Updated Status**: Use the `check_internship_status()` method again to see updated internship status."
