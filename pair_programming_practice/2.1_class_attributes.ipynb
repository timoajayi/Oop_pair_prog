That is, we write `class`, then the name of the class that we are defining, followed by a set of parentheses, and finally a colon. After the colon is an indented block of code that we use to define the class attributes and methods. One subtle difference is that with functions, the standard is to name these in lowercase and separating words with underscores (i.e. *snake_case*); with classes, the standard is to name these capitalized, and not separate words at all (i.e. *CamelCase*).

In addition, any arguments that we pass to the `Unicorn()` constructor that we use during instantiation are passed to the `__init__()` method. But wait... In the `__init__()` method definition you have it accepting the `self` parameter, but don't pass any arguments during instantiation? The reason for this is that by default, Python passes a reference to the instance (which is what `self` is) as the first argument in any method that is defined within the class. Let's dive into this a little deeper...   \n",

    "`self` is what we use inside of the class to access attributes or methods of the class. Notice that we do this with dot notation - e.g. by placing a period after `self`, and then the name of the attribute or method that we want to access. When we write `self.name = 'Glitter'`, then, what we are doing is accessing `self.name` and then assigning it the value of 'Glitter'. Outside of the class, we access this attribute (or any attribute/method) again via dot notation, but replacing `self` with the variable name that holds a reference to our instantiated object (above this is `another_uni`).
