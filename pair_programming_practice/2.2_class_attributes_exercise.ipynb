    "Before we get to actually learning how to build a class, it'll be helpful to recap some of the terminology surrounding classes/OOP. Often times, the terminology can be the most confusing part of learning OOP. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Class** - Used to refer to the abstract concept of an object.\n",
    "2. **Object** - An actual instance of a class.\n",
    "3. **Instance** - What Python returns when you tell it to create a class.\n",
    "4. **Instantiation** - A fancy way of saying that we're going to create an instance of a class. \n",
    "5. **Constructor** - What we call to instantiate a class. \n",
    "6. **self** - Inside of a class, a variable for the instance/object being accessed (i.e. it holds a reference to the instance/object of that class).\n",
    "7. **attribute**/**field**/**property** - A piece of data that a class has, stored in a variable. Inside of a class definition, all attributes/fields/properties are accessed via `self.<attribute>`, while on an instance, they are accessed via `<variable name>.<attribute>`.\n",
    "8. **method**/**procedure** - A block of code that is accessible via the class, and typically acts on or with the classes' attributes/fields/properties. Inside of a class definition, all methods/procedures are created via `def` (they are really just functions), and accessible via `self.<method>()`, while on an instance, they are accessed via `<variable name>.<method>()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Don't worry if this terminology isn't 100% clear at this point in time. It should become more clear as we work through these notes, and should be a useful reference. From here on out, we'll treat attribute, field, and property as interchangeable, and we'll do the same with method and procedure.\n"
