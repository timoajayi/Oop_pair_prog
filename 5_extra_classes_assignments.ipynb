    "Today we're going to be taking a look at classes, and the OOP paradigm in general. The problems in this assignment are designed to help you develop an intuition for both why we like object oriented programming **and** when we want to use it. The first part of this assignment will revolve around taking a problem that has been solved with functions (which will be given to you) and turning it into a class. The second part will have you write a class from scratch, starting from the mindset of functions. The last part will give you a problem that has been solved with a class; however, it will be a poor choice of using OOP. Here, you'll blow up the class and move the code back into a solely functional programming paradigm. Hopefully this will give you an idea of problems that still ought to be solved with functions. \n",

    "Imagine you are waiting tables. At the end of each night, you have to find all you're bills, and total the amount that you will be tipped; this will depend on what a client decided, or 18% if they didn't specify. You always end up spending an extra 10 minutes at the end of your shift calculating how much you made in tips, and as a result you decide to write a Python script to help automate the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a little trial and error, you come up with the functions below. The `0.18` is for the standard tip your restaurant charges if none is specified.\n",
    "\n",

    "def get_tips(bills_n_tips):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Calculate the tip for each bill based on the corresponding tip rate.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    This function takes a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a bill amount\n",
    "    and a tip rate, and returns a list of calculated tips for each bill.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    tips = []\n",
    "    for bill,tip in bills_n_tips\n",
    "    tips.append(bill*tip)\n",
    "    return tips\n",
    "    \n",
    "def add_bill_update_tips(new_bill, bills_n_tips, tip_rate=0.18):\n",
    "    \"\"\"Adds a new bill along with a specified or default tip rate to the list of bills and tips,\n",
    "    then calculates and returns the total amount of tips accumulated from all bills.\n",
    "    \"\"\"\n",
    "    bills_n_tips.append((new_bill, tip_rate))\n",
    "    tip_out = sum(get_tips(bills_n_tips))\n",
    "    return tip_out\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You then test them out with the following function. Who doesn't like well tested code??\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def test_tip_out():\n",
    "    waiter_bills_n_tips = []\n",
    "    print (add_bill_update_tips(58.90, waiter_bills_n_tips, 0.15))\n",
    "    print (add_bill_update_tips(31.58, waiter_bills_n_tips))\n",
    "    print (add_bill_update_tips(81.44, waiter_bills_n_tips, 0.20))\n",
    "    print (get_tips(waiter_bills_n_tips))\n",
    "    print (len(waiter_bills_n_tips))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As everything appears to be working, you happily go to work and keep track of your tips. Everything works out, as expected. After all, you did your due diligence and tested your code. However, running the same function over and over (and having to make sure that you we're passing the correct things to your function while you were trying to work) quickly becomes a burden. In addition, some of your coworkers see what you were doing and want to try your code next time you work. You wonder to yourself if there is a simpler way to implement a solution to this problem, one where anyone could easily and intuitively use the program your wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "Luckily, you learned about classes in Python recently and realize that this is a great situation to employ them! The first thing you do is sit down and think about how you'd want to use a class in this scenario. You want a class that allows you to track and get information about the status of your tips. Here's an example usage of the class you're going to build:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tot = TipOutTracker(0.18)\n",
    "tot.add_bill(58.90, 0.15)\n",

    "print (tot.total_tip_out())\n",
    "tot.add_bill(81.44, 0.20)\n",
    "print (len(tot))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, when you get the length of your tracker, you are actually going to get the total number of bills you've served.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, your task is to take the code from the function solution of this problem and write a class `TipOutTracker`. This class will operate in the way shown above. You should be thinking about the following as you start solving this problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the attributes (data) that you are going to store on the class?\n",
    "    * What data is being abstracted away from the user of your class?\n",
    "* What are the methods (functions) that you are going to operate on the attributes with?\n",
